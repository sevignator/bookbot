# Bookbot project

My personal solution to the [Build a Bookbot](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot) project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

## Set up

1. From the root directory, create a sub-directory named `books/` and a new file within it named `frankenstein.txt`.
2. Copy the contents of [*Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) into `frankenstein.txt`.
3. Run the main Python script.

    ```python
    python main.py
    ```
